write_hw_ila_data

Description: 
Write hardware ILA data to a file

Syntax: 
write_hw_ila_data  [-force] [-csv_file] [-vcd_file] [-quiet] [-verbose] <file>
                   [<hw_ila_data>] [<hw_ila_data>]

Returns: 
Name of the output file

Usage: 
  Name             Description
  ----------------------------
  [-force]         Overwrite existing file
  [-csv_file]      Export CSV format file only
  [-vcd_file]      Export VCD format file only
  [-quiet]         Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]       Suspend message limits during command execution
  <file>           hardware ILA data file name
  [<hw_ila_data>]  hardware ILA data object
                   Default: Current hardware ILA data

Categories: 
Hardware

Description:

  Write the ILA debug core sample data, stored in the specified hw_ila_data
  object, to a binary file on the disk.

  A hw_ila_data object is created when the hw_ila is triggered on the
  hw_device, or by the upload_hw_ila_data command when moving the captured
  data from the physical FPGA device, hw_device.

  The write_hw_ila_data lets you write the data of the hw_ila_data object to
  a binary file on the disk for later review. You can read the ILA debug core
  data back into the Vivado logic analyzer using the read_hw_ila_data
  command, which creates a new hw_ila_data object.

  This command returns the name of the file written, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing file of the same name if one
  exists.

  -csv_file - (Optional) Export a comma-separated values (CSV) file only.
  This configures the write_hw_ila_data command to export the ILA data in the
  form of a CSV file that can be used to import into a spreadsheet or
  third-party application, rather than the default binary ILA file format.

  -vcd_file - (Optional) Export a value change dump (VCD) file only. This
  configures the write_hw_ila_data command to export the ILA data in the form
  of a VCD file that can be used to import into a third-party application or
  viewer, rather than the default binary ILA file format.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename of the ILA data file to write. The default
  file extension for an ILA data file is .ila. The default file extension for
  -csv_file is .csv, and for -vcd_file is .vcd.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  <hw_ila_data> - (Optional) The hardware ILA data to write to the specified
  file. The hw_ila_data must be specified as an object, as returned by the
  get_hw_ila_datas or the current_hw_ila_data commands. If no hw_ila_data
  object is specified, the current hw_ila_data is written to the specified
  file.

Example:

  The following example uploads the data from the hw_ila debug core into a
  hw_ila_data object, and then writes that data object to the specified ILA
  data file, overwriting an existing file if one exists:

    write_hw_ila_data -force design1_ila_data [upload_hw_ila_data hw_ila_1]

  This example triggers the hw_ila, then writes the captured hw_ila_data to a
  CSV file:

    run_hw_ila hw_ila_1 
    write_hw_ila_data -csv_file C:/Data/design1_ila_data [current_hw_ila_data]
